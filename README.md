# WatchList

Welcome to my first React Project! IÂ´m working on this project to gain more knowledge and practice my React skills.

With WachList you will create a list of Movies and TV Shows you want to watch, or have watched. The search functionality is built using the great API from [TheMovieDB](https://themoviedb.org).

Currently, I'm working on the implementation of User's SignUp and Login functionality trough [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Responsive
- CRUD functionality
- SignUp and LogIn

## Using

uuidv4 for generating Unique Id Keys for list's childs
