# WatchList

Welcome to my first React Project! IÂ´m working on this project to gain more knowledge and practice my React skills.

With WachList you will create a list of Movies and TV Shows you want to watch, or have watched. The search functionality is built using the great API from [TheMovieDB](https://themoviedb.org).
